          I want to express myself as someone who was once a sinner, living in
          darkness. But through the love of our Holy Father, revealed in His
          Son, Jesus Christ, I have come into the light from darkness, into
          blessed hope from hopelessness, into deep joy from depression, and
          into strength from brokenness. Now, I live by faith, sanctified by the
          Holy Spirit and guided by the Scriptures.

          When I think about myself, the first thing that sparks in my mind and
          heart at the same time is the depth of Christ's love for us—even when
          we were against Him. As Paul says in Romans 5:10, "For if, while we
          were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to Him through the death of His
          Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through
          His life!" <br/> I cannot even imagine what our fate would be without Him.
          As John 10:16 says, "I have other sheep that are not of this sheep
          pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and
          there shall be one flock and one shepherd." I am one of those
          sheep—called into His fold and safely under His care as my Shepherd.
