          "I found the one my heart loves." – Song of Solomon 3:4<br><br>
          Our story began in the most unexpected way. Sam and Betty first crossed paths at a church retreat, where they were both serving on the worship team. As they sang praises together, their hearts began to harmonize in more ways than one. It was as if God had orchestrated their meeting, just as He brought Ruth to Boaz in the fields of Bethlehem. Over time, their friendship blossomed into a deep and abiding love, rooted in faith and shared values.

          "Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death." – Song of Solomon 8:6<br><br>
          On a serene evening under the stars, Sam led Betty to a beautifully decorated garden, reminiscent of the fields where Boaz pledged his love to Ruth. As they stood surrounded by twinkling lights and the fragrance of blooming flowers, Sam knelt down and asked Betty to be his partner for life. With tears of joy and a heart full of gratitude, Betty said "Yes," knowing that their love was a gift from God, meant to be cherished forever.
